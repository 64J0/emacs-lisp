So you've installed Emacs. Now what?

Well, you can start the tutoral by pressing =C-h t=, and that's not a bad place
to start. If you're completely new to Emacs, the [Emacs Prelude](http://batsov.com/prelude/) package offers a
nice set of sensible defaults and packages.

The best documentation on Emacs Lisp is... shipped with Emacs itself!

From the [EmacsWiki Entry](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLisp):

[EmacsLispReference](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLispReference) is the official Emacs Lisp documentation. It is built into
the Emacs Info pages and is the go-to for most Elisp programmers.  It is shipped
with Emacs and can be accessed by the menu bar, with `M-x menu-bar-read-lispref`,
or from the top page of [InfoMode](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InfoMode).

[EmacsLispIntro](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLispIntro) is a book for non-programmers available from the [Free Software Foundation](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FreeSoftwareFoundation)
and is shipped with Emacs. Its command is `M-x menu-bar-read-lispintro`.

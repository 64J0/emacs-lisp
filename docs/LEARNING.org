So you've installed Emacs. Now what?

Well, you can start the tutoral by pressing `C-h t`, and that's not a bad
place to start. If you're completely new to Emacs, the [Emacs Prelude][prelude]
package offers a nice set of sensible defaults and packages.

A guide I wrote a while ago  for getting started with the editor
(including Prelude) can be found [here][dark-side].

The best documentation on Emacs Lisp is... shipped with Emacs itself!

From the [EmacsWiki Entry][wiki-elisp]:

[EmacsLispReference][elref] is the official Emacs Lisp documentation. It
is built into the Emacs Info pages and is the go-to for most Elisp programmers.
It is shipped with Emacs and can be accessed by the menu bar, with
`M-x menu-bar-read-lispref`, or from the top page of [InfoMode][infomode].

[EmacsLispIntro][elintro] is a book for non-programmers available from the
[Free Software Foundation][fsf] and is shipped with Emacs. Its command is
`M-x menu-bar-read-lispinfo`.

So you've installed Emacs. Now what?

Well, you can start the tutoral by pressing =C-h t=, and that's not a bad place
to start. If you're completely new to Emacs, the [[http://batsov.com/prelude/][Emacs Prelude]] package offers a
nice set of sensible defaults and packages.

The best documentation on Emacs Lisp is... shipped with Emacs itself!

From the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLisp][EmacsWiki Entry]]:

[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLispReference][EmacsLispReference]] is the official Emacs Lisp documentation. It is built into
the Emacs Info pages and is the go-to for most Elisp programmers.  It is shipped
with Emacs and can be accessed by the menu bar, with =M-x
menu-bar-read-lispref=, or from the top page of [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InfoMode][InfoMode]].

[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsLispIntro][EmacsLispIntro]] is a book for non-programmers available from the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FreeSoftwareFoundation][Free Software
Foundation]] and is shipped with Emacs. Its command is =M-x
menu-bar-read-lispintro=.

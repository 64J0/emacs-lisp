** Getting Help

1. [[http://emacswiki.org/][The Emacs Wiki]] is invaluable. Spend lots of time here.
2. [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html][The Emacs Editor]] is the official manual for GNU Emacs.
3. IRC - there are [[https://freenode.net/][freenode]] channels for =#emacs=, =#prelude=, and many Emacs
   packages, and many helpful folks around. And with emacs, IRC is as close as
   =M-x erc=.
4. [[https://gitter.im/exercism/support][Exercism Support]] Gitter chat is also a good place to get help from the
   exercism community.

## Getting Help

1. [The Emacs Wiki][wiki] is invaluable. Spend lots of time here.
2. [The Emacs Editor][man] is the official manual for GNU Emacs.
3. IRC - there are [freenode][freenode] channels for #emacs, #prelude, and many
Emacs packages, and many helpful folks around. And with emacs, IRC is as close
as `M-x erc`.
4. [Exercism Support][support] Gitter chat is also a good place to get help from
the exercism community.
